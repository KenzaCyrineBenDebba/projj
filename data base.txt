The above SQL statement code will create the products table with the following columns:

id — Unique ID for the product, this will be auto incremented.
name — The name of the product.
desc — The description of the product.
price — The price of the product.
rrp — The retail pricing, if you want a product on sale you put the value higher than the price.
date_added — The date the product was added, we'll use this for sorting products.
The SQL statement will also insert 4 example products, these are just examples for the tutorial, you can change/remove them later on.
